# Successive Refinement in Large-Scale Computation
This projects explores solutions for massive computation with layered resolution. as described in the paper "Successive Refinement in Large-Scale Computation: Expediting Model Inference Applications".

# Project Structure

## Succcessive Refinement for CIFAR10 classification using a trained VGG16 model architecture
The folder "Successice_Refinement_CIFAR10_VGG16" containes the necessary codes.

Download the [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset Python version. Unzip the file and place the "cifar-10-batches-py" folder somewhere accessible.
Install miniconda if you haven't already.
The dependencies will be later uploaded. Install the dependencies by running "conda env create -f environment.yml" inside the root of this project.
It will create a new environment and install all dependencies.
